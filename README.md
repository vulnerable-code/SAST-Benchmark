# SAST-Benchmark By SECOLOGIST
## Introduction
[**SECOLOGIST's SAST-Benchmark**](https://www.secologist.com/sast-benchmark) is an open-source platform to compare and assess the effectiveness of various Static Application Security Testing (SAST) solutions in the industry, including free-to-use tools for a variety of programming languages and frameworks. The performance of each SAST is measured against multiple criteria.
